\section{Consistency Increase and Maintainment}
\begin{definition}[\textbf{layer of a subcondition}]
	Let a condition $c$ in ANF and a subcondition $d$ of $c$ be given.
	The \emph{layer of d} is defined as $\lay(d) := \nlvl(c) - \nlvl(d)$.
\end{definition}

Our approach is based on the idea that the consistency of a constraint increases layer by layer, and that even small improvements, such as inserting single elements of existentially bound graphs, should be detectable as increasing.
To formalise this, we introduce the notions of \emph{consistency increasing} and \emph{consistency maintaining} transformations and rules, where consistency increasing indicates that the consistency has actually increased and consistency maintaining indicates that the consistency has not decreased.
