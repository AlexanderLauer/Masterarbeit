\section{Consistency Increase- and Maintainment}
\begin{definition}[\textbf{layer of a sub-condition}]
	Let $c$ be a condition in ANF and $d$ a sub-condition of $c$.
	The \emph{layer of d} is defined as $\lay(d) := \nlvl(c) - \nlvl(d)$.
\end{definition}

Our approach is based on the idea that the consistency of a constraint is 
increased layer by layer and even slight improvements like the insertion
of single elements of existentially bound graphs should be detectable as increasing.
To formalise this, we introduce the notions of \emph{consistency increasing}
and \emph{consistency maintaining} transformations and rules with  
consistency increasing indication that the consistency has indeed been increased 
and consistency maintaining indicating that the consistency has not been decreased.
