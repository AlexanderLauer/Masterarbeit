\subsection{Repairing rule Sets}

\begin{definition}[\textbf{repairing rule set}]
Let a constraint $c$ in UANF and a set of rules $\mathcal{R}$ be given. 
Then, $\mathcal{R}$ is called a \emph{repairing rule set for $c$ at layer $k$}  if for all graphs $G$ with $\kmax = k$ a sequence 
$$G = G_0 \Longrightarrow_{\rho_0} \ldots \Longrightarrow_{\rho_{n-1}} G_n = H$$
exists, such that $\maxk{c}{H} \geq \maxk{c}{G} +2$ and $\rho_j \in \mathcal{R}$ for all $0 \leq j \leq n-1$. 

\end{definition}


\begin{corollary}
	Let a constraint $c$ in UANF and a rule set $\mathcal{R}$ be given. If either (a)
	$\mathcal{R}$ is a repairing rule set at layer $k$ for all odd $0 \leq k \leq \nlvl(c)$
	or (b) $\mathcal{R}$ is a repairing rule set at layer $k$ with $k$ being even and $\mathcal{R}$
	is also a repairing rule set for all odd $0 \leq j <k$ then for all graphs $G$ a sequence
	$$G = G_0 \Longrightarrow_{\rho_0} \ldots \Longrightarrow_{\rho_{n-1}} G_n$$ 
	with $G_n \models c$ and $\rho_j \in \mathcal{R}$ for all $0 \leq j \leq n-1$ exists.
\end{corollary}
