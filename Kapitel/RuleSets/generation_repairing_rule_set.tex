\subsection{Construction of Repairing Sets}

In the following we want to introduce a construction of these 
repairing sets for a given circular conflict free constraint in UANF. 

\begin{definition}[\textbf{constructed repairing set}]\label{def_constr_rep}
	Let a circular conflict free constraint $c$ in UANF with $\nlvl(c) > 1$ or 
	$c = \forall(C_1, \false$ and $E_{C_1} \neq \emptyset$ be given. 
	The \emph{constructed repairing set}, $\mathcal{R}$, for $c$ is constructed 
	in the following way.
	For each universally bound graph $C_k$ of $c$  and every pair of graphs 
	$C, C' \ig{C_{k-1}}{C_k}$ with $C$ being a sub-graph of $C'$ there does 
	exist a rule 
	$$ \rle{C'}{a_{k-1}^r}{C}{\id}{C}$$
	in $\mathcal{R}$. 
	For each existentially bound graph $C_k$ of $c$ and every pair of graphs
	$C, C' \in \ig{C_{k-1}}{C_k}$ with $C$ being a sub-graph of $C'$ there does 
	exist a rule  
	$$\rle{C}{\id}{C}{a_{k-1}^r}{C'}$$ 
	in $\mathcal{R}$.
\end{definition}
Note that for each element of existentially bound graphs, $\mathcal{R}$ contains a rule that only inserts this element, and for each element of universally bound graphs $\mathcal{R}$ contains a rule that only removes this element. 

\begin{theorem}
	Let a circular conflict free constraint $c$ in UANF with $\nlvl(c) > 1$ 
	or $c = \forall(C_1, \false)$ and $E_{C_0} \neq \emptyset$ be given. 
	The set of rules constructed by Definition \ref{def_constr_rep} is a 
	repairing set w.r.t. $c$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\mathcal{R}$ be the constructed rule set.
	If $\nlvl(c)= 1$ and $E_{C_1}\neq \emptyset$, there does exist a rule
	$\rho = \rle{C_1}{a_0^r}{C'}{\id}{C}$ with $C \in \ig{\emptyset}{C_1}$ 
	such that $V_C = V_{C_0}$. Then,
	$$C_1 \Longrightarrow_{\rho,\id} C$$ 
	is a repairing sequence for $C_1$ and $\mathcal{R}$ is a repairing rule set 
	for $c$. 
	
	If $	\nlvl(c) \geq 2$, consider an existentially bound graph $C_k$ 
	and the transformation sequence 
	$$C_{k-1} \Longrightarrow_{\rho_1, m} C_{k}$$
	with $\rho_1 = \rle{C_{k-1}}{\id}{C_{k-1}}{a_{k-1}}{C_k}$. 
	If $C_k$ has no conflict with an universally bound graph $C_j$ with 
	$j < k$, $C_k \models_k c$ and this is a repairing sequence. 
	If, $C_k \not \models_k c$, an occurrence $p$ of an universally bound graph 
	$C_j$ with $j < k$ has been inserted.
	Then, the repairing sequence can be extended by 
	$$C_k \Longrightarrow_{\rho_2,m} G_1$$ 
	with $\rho_2 = \rle{C}{\id}{C}{a_j^r}{C_{j+1}}$ such that $C \in \ig{C_j}
	{C_{j+1}}$ and $V_C = V_{C_{k+1}}$. with $p = m \circ a_{j-1}^r$.
	Since $j< k$, such a match and transformation must exist.
	If this inserts new occurrences of universally bound graphs $C_{j'}$ with 
	$j' < k$, we repeat this process.
