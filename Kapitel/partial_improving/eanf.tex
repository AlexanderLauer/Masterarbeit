\subsection{Universally quantified ANF}
To prevent the need of case discrimination, we will only consider a subset of the set of conditions in ANF, namely the set of universally quantified conditions in ANF, called \emph{universally quantified alternating quantifier normal form} (UANF). 
Additionally we will show that these sets are expressively equivalent by showing that each condition in ANF can be transformed into an equivalent condition in UANF.


\begin{definition}[\textbf{Universally quantified alternating quantifier normal form}]
A conditions $c$ in ANF is in \emph{universally quantified ANF} (UANF) if it is universally bound. 
\end{definition}


Note that, given a condition $c$ in UANF, every subcondition of $c$ at layer $0 \leq k \leq \nlvl(c)$ is universally bound, if $k$ is an even number and existentially bound, if $k$ is an odd number.  



\begin{lemma}
Any condition in ANF can be transformed into an equivalent condition in UANF. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let a graph $G$ and a constraint $c$ in ANF be given.
If $c$ is universally bound, $c$ is already in UANF. 

If $c = \exists(a_0: C_0 \inj C_1,d)$, we show that $c$ is equivalent to $c' := \forall(\id_{C_0}: C_0 \inj C_0, c)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Let $p :C_0 \inj G$ be a morphism, such that $q \models c$. 
Therefore a morphism $q : C_0 \to G$ with $q \models e$ and $p = q \circ a_1$ exists.
Then, $p \models d$, since $p$ is the only morphism from $C_0$ to $G$ with $p = p \circ \id_{C_0}$ and $p \models c$. 

\item 
Let $p:C_0 \inj G$ be a morphism with $p \models c'$, therefore all morphisms $q:C_0 \inj G$ with $p = q \circ \id_{C_0}$ satisfy $c$. Since $p = p \circ \id_{C_0}$, $p \models c$ follows immediately.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

For we rest of this thesis, given a condition $c = \forall(a:C_0 \inj C_1, d)$ in UANF, we assume that no morphism in $c$, except $a$, is an isomorphism since it can be shown that each condition in ANF can be transformed into an equivalent condition in ANF fulfilling this property.
