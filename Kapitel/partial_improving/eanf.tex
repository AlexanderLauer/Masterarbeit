\subsection{extended alternating quantifier normal form}
To prevent the need of case discrimination, a new normal form for conditions, called \emph{extended alternating quantifier normal form} (EANF), will be introduced. 
The sets of conditions in ANF and EANF do intersect and we show that both sets are expressively equivalent. 

\begin{definition}[\textbf{extended alternating quantifier normal form}]
A conditions $c$ is in \emph{extended alternating quantifier normal form} (EANF) if it is of the form $\forall(a_0:C_0 \inj C_1,d)$ and $d$ is a condition in ANF.
\end{definition}


Note that, given a condition $c$ in EANF, every subcondition of $c$ at layer $1 \leq k \leq \nl(c)$ is universally bound, if $k$ is an odd number and existentially bound, if $k$ is an even number.  



\begin{lemma}
Any condition in ANF can be transformed into an equivalent condition in EANF and vice versa. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

\enquote{$\Longrightarrow$}:
Let a graph $G$ and a constraint $c$ in ANF be given.
If $c$ is universally, $c$ is already in EANF. 

If $c = \exists(a_0: C_0 \inj C_1,d)$, we show that $c$ is equivalent to $c' := \forall(\id_{C_0}: C_0 \inj C_0, c)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Let $p :C_0 \inj G$ be a morphism, such that $q \models c$. 
Therefore a morphism $q : C_0 \to G$ with $q \models e$ and $p = q \circ a_1$ exists.
Then, $p \models d$, since $p$ is the only morphism from $C_0$ to $G$ with $p = p \circ \id_{C_0}$ and $p \models c$. 

\item 
Let $p:C_0 \inj G$ be a morphism with $p \models c'$, therefore all morphisms $q:C_0 \inj G$ with $p = q \circ \id_{C_0}$ satisfy $c$. Since $p = p \circ \id_{C_0}$, $p \models c$ follows immediately.
\end{enumerate}
\enquote{$\Longleftarrow$}:
Let a graph $G$ and a constraint $c$ in EANF be given. 
If $c = \forall(a_0: C_0 \inj C_1,d)$ with $C_0 \neq C_1$, $c$ is already in ANF. 

Otherwise, the equivalence of $c$ with $d$ can be shown analogously to the first case.

\end{proof}
