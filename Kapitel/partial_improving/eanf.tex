\subsection{extended alternating quantifier normal form}

\begin{definition}[\textbf{extended alternating quantifier normal form}]
A constraint $c$ is in \emph{extended alternating quantified normal form} (EANF) if $c$ is in ANF and universally bound. 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
Any constraint in ANF can be transformed into an equivalent constraint in EANF. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $c$ be a constraint in ANF. 
If $c$ is universally bound, $c$ is already in EANF. 

If $c = \exists(a_1: \emptyset \inj C_0,e)$ is existentially bound, we show that $c$ is equivalent to $d := \forall(a_0: \emptyset \inj \emptyset, c)$.
Let $G$ be a graph. 

\enquote{$\Longrightarrow:$}
Let $p: \emptyset \inj G$ be a morphism with $p \models c$, therefore a morphism $q : C_0 \to G$ with $q \models e$ and $p = q \circ a_0$ exists.
Then, $p \models d$, since $p$ is the only morphism from $\emptyset$ to $G$ and $p = p \circ a_1$ and $p \models c$. 

\enquote{$\Longleftarrow:$}
Let $p: \emptyset \inj G$ be a morphism with $p \models d$, therefore all morphisms $q : \emptyset \inj G$ with $p = q \circ a_0$ satisfy $c$. 
With $p = p \circ a_0$, $p \models c$ follows immediately.
\end{proof}
