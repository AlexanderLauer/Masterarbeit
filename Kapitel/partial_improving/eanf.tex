\subsection{Universally quantified ANF}
The definition of consistency increase- and maintainment demands that every 
existentially bound sub-condition of a given condition in ANF is embedded into an 
universally bound condition. Otherwise, case discrimination is needed. 
This requirement is not met if and only if the given condition is existentially 
bound. 
Therefore, we will only consider a subset of the set of conditions in ANF, namely the set of universally quantified conditions in ANF, called \emph{universally quantified ANF} (UANF). 
Additionally, we will show that these sets are expressively equivalent by showing that each condition in ANF can be transformed into an equivalent condition in UANF.


\begin{definition}[\textbf{universally quantified alternating quantifier normal form}]
A conditions $c$ in ANF is in \emph{universally quantified ANF} (UANF) if it is universally bound. 
\end{definition}


Note that, given a condition $c$ in UANF, every sub-condition of $c$ at layer $0 \leq k \leq \nlvl(c)$ is universally bound if $k$ is an even number and existentially bound if $k$ is an odd number.  
The extension of conditions that is used to show that a conditions in ANF
can be transformed into an equivalent condition in UANF is an already known concept \cite{Pennemann09a}.


\begin{lemma}
Any condition in ANF can be transformed into an equivalent condition in UANF. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let a graph $G$ and a constraint $c$ in ANF be given.
If $c$ is universally bound, $c$ is already in UANF. 

If $c = \exists(a_0: C_0 \inj C_1,d)$, we show that $c$ is equivalent to $c' := \forall(\id_{C_0}: C_0 \inj C_0, c)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Let $p :C_0 \inj G$ be a morphism, such that $q \models c$. 
Then, $p \models c'$, since $p$ is the only morphism from $C_0$ to $G$ with $p = p \circ \id_{C_0}$ and $p \models c$. 

\item 
Let $p:C_0 \inj G$ be a morphism with $p \models c'$, therefore all morphisms $q:C_0 \inj G$ with $p = q \circ \id_{C_0}$ satisfy $c$. Since $p = p \circ \id_{C_0}$, $p \models c$ follows immediately.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

For the rest of this thesis, given a condition $c = \forall(a_0:C_0 \inj C_1, d)$ in UANF, we assume that no morphism in $c$, except $a_0$, is bijective since it can be shown that each condition in ANF can be transformed into an equivalent condition in ANF fulfilling this property by showing that
$\exists(a_0 : C_0 \inj C_0, \forall(a_1: C_0 \inj C_2,d)$ is equivalent to
$\forall(a_1 \circ a_0 : C_0 \inj C_2,d)$ and that $\forall(a_0 : C_0 \inj C_0, \exists(a_1: C_0 \inj C_2,d)$ is equivalent to
$\exists(a_1 \circ a_0 : C_0 \inj C_2,d)$ .
