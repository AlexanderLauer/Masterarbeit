\subsection{Universally quantified ANF}
The definition of consistency increase and maintainment requires that each condition begins with a universal quantifier. Otherwise, case discrimination is required.  Therefore, we will only consider a subset of the set of conditions in ANF, namely the set of universally quantified conditions in ANF, called \emph{universally quantified ANF} (UANF). Furthermore, we will show that these sets are expressively equivalent by showing that every condition in ANF can be transformed into an equivalent condition in UANF.


\begin{definition}[\textbf{universally quantified alternating quantifier normal form}]
A conditions $c$ in ANF is in \emph{universally quantified ANF} (UANF) if it is universally bound. 
\end{definition}


Note that, given a condition $c$ in UANF, any subcondition of $c$ at layer $0 \leq k \leq \nlvl(c)$ is universally bound if $k$ is an even number and existentially bound if $k$ is an odd number. Furthermore, a graph $C_k$ of $c$ is  universally bound if $k$ is an odd number and existentially bound if 
$k$ is an even number.  
It is already known that an existentially bound condition $c$ 
can be extended to the equivalent condition $\exists(a_0: \emptyset \inj C_0, d)$ \cite{habel2005nested}.
We will use this to show that every condition in ANF has an 
equivalent condition in UANF.


\begin{lemma}
Any condition in ANF can be transformed into an equivalent condition in UANF. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let a graph $G$ and a constraint $c$ in ANF be given.
If $c$ is universally bound, then $c$ is already in UANF. 
If $c = \exists(a_0: C_0 \inj C_1,d)$, we show that $c$ is equivalent to $c' := \forall(\id_{C_0}: C_0 \inj C_0, c)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Let $p :C_0 \inj G$ be a morphism such that $q \models c$. 
Then $p \models c'$, because $p$ is the only morphism from $C_0$ to $G$ with $p = p \circ \id_{C_0}$ and $p \models c$.

\item 
Let $p:C_0 \inj G$ be a morphism with $p \models c'$, then all morphisms $q:C_0 \inj G$ with $p = q \circ \id_{C_0}$ satisfy $c$. Since $p = p \circ \id_{C_0}$, it immediately follows that $p \models c$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

For the rest of this thesis, given a condition $c = \forall(a_0 : C_0 \inj C_1, d)$ in UANF, we assume that no morphism in $c$, except $a_0$, is bijective, since it can be shown that every condition in ANF can be transformed into an equivalent condition in ANF that satisfies this property, by showing that
$\exists(a_0 : C_0 \inj C_0, \forall(a_1: C_0 \inj C_2,d)$ is equivalent to
$\forall(a_1 \circ a_0 : C_0 \inj C_2,d)$ and that $\forall(a_0 : C_0 \inj C_0, \exists(a_1: C_0 \inj C_2,d)$ is equivalent to
$\exists(a_1 \circ a_0 : C_0 \inj C_2,d)$ .
