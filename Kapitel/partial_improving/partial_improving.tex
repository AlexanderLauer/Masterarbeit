\begin{definition}[\textbf{Condition up to layer}]
Let $c$ be a condition and $d$ a subcondition of $c$. 
The layer of $d$ is defined as $\lay(d) := \nl(c) - \nl(d) - 1$.

Let $L$ be the set of subconditions of $c$ with layer $k$. 
The \emph{condition up to layer} $k$ of $c$ is the condition which is obtained by replacing each $d = Q(a: P \inj P',e) \in L$ by $d = Q(a: P \inj P',\true)$ if $Q = \exists$ and by $Q(a: P \inj P',\false)$ if $Q = \forall$  in $c$. 
If $k =0$, the condition up to layer $k$ of every condition $c$ is $\true$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[\textbf{layered consistency}]
	Let $G$ be a graph, $p: C_0 \to G$ a morphism, $c$ a condition over $C_0$ and $d$ the condition up to layer $k$ of $c$. 
	The morphism $p$ \emph{satisfies $c$ up to layer} $k$ if $p \models d$.
	The notation $p \models_k  c$ is used if $p$ satisfies $c$ up to layer $k$. 
	The notation $G \models_k c$ is used if $c$ is a constraint and $p \models_k c$ for $p: \emptyset \to G$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma_help_lay_sat}
Let $G$ be a graph $p: C_0 \to G$ a morphism and $c = Q(a_1: C_0 \inj C_1, \overline{Q}(a_2: C_1 \inj C_2, \ldots))$ a condition over $C_0$ in ANF with $p \models_k c$.
If the subcondition $d = \forall(a_k: C_{k-1} \inj C_k,e)$ of $c$ at layer $k$ is universally bound, $p \models Q(a_1: C_0 \inj C_1, \overline{Q}(a_2: C_1 \inj C_2, \ldots \forall(a_k: C_{k-1} \inj C_k,f)))$ for every condition $f$ over $C_k$.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $k$ be the smallest number such that $p \models_k c$ and the subcondition of $c$ with layer $k$ is universally bound, let $d = \forall(a_k: C_{k-1} \inj C_k, e)$ be this subcondition.
Let $q: G_{k-1} \to G$ be a morphism such that $q \models \forall(a_k:C_{k-1} \inj C_k, \false)$. 
This must exist, since $p \models_k c$ and $k$ is the smallest number such that $p \models_k v$ and the subcondition of $c$ with layer $k$ is universally bound. 

Therefore, there does not exist a morphism $q': C_k \to G$ with $q = q' \circ a_k$.
Hence, for every condition $f$ over $C_k$ a morphism $q': C_k \to G$ with $q \not \models f$ and $q = q' \circ a_k$ cannot exist. 
It follows immediately that $q \models \forall(a_k:C_{k-1} \inj C_k, f)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\label{lemma_lay_sat}

Let $G$ be a graph, $p: C_0 \to G$ a morphism and $c$ a condition over $C_0$ in ANF with $p \models_k c$.
If the subcondition $d$ of $c$ with $\lay(d) = k$ is universally bound, $p \models_k c$ implies $p \models c$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Follows immediately by using lemma \ref{lemma_help_lay_sat} and setting $f$ to the subcondition of $c$ with layer $k+1$.
\end{proof}



\begin{lemma}\label{lemma_part_satisfiability}
	Let $c = Q(a_1: C_0, \inj C_1, \ldots)$ be a condition in ANF over $C_0$ and $p: C_0 \to G$ a morphism with $p \models_k c$. 
	Let $d = Q'(a_{k+1}: C_{k} \inj C_{k+1}, \overline{Q'}(a_{k+2}: C_{k+1} \inj C_{k+2},e))$ be the subcondition of $c$ with layer $k+1$. 
	There does exist a graph $C_{k+1} \subseteq C' \subseteq C_{k+2}$ such that $p \models Q(a_1: C_0, \inj C_1, \ldots Q'(a_{k+1}: C_{k} \inj C_{k+1}, \overline{Q'}(a'_{k+2}: C_{k+1} \inj C',f))$ with $f$ being a $Q'$ bound condition over $C'$ and $a'_{k+2}$ being a partial morphism of $a_{k+2}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
If $p \models c$, we can choose $C' = C_{k+2}$ and $f = e$.
If $p \not \models c$, there does not exists a $j$ with $p \models_j c$ and the subcondition of $c$ with layer $j$ is universally bound and $Q' = \forall$ follows.
We choose $C' = C_{k+1}$ and $f = \true$. Let $q: C_{k} \to G$ with $p = q \circ a_k \circ \ldots \circ a_1$ and $q \circ \ldots \circ a_{\ell}$ satisfying the condition up to $\ell - k$ of the subcondition of $c$ at layer $\ell$  for all $0 \leq \ell \leq k$.
This morphism must exists since $p \models_k c$ and $p \not \models c$. 
Let $q': C_{k+1} \to G$ be a morphism with $q = q' \circ a_{k+1}$.  Since $C' = C_{k+1}$, the morphism $a'_{k+2}$ has to be the identity and therefore $q' = q' \circ a'_{k+2}$. It follows that $q' \models \exists(a'_{k+2}: C_{k+1} \inj C', \true)$ and therefore $p \models Q(a_1: C_0, \inj C_1, \ldots \forall(a_{k+1}: C_{k} \inj C_{k+1}, \exists(a'_{k+2}: C_{k+1} \inj C_{k+1},\true))$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[\textbf{biggest partially satisfying graph}]
Let $G$ be a graph, $c = Q(a_1: C_0, \inj C_1, \ldots)$ a condition in ANF and $p: C_0 \to G$ a morphism with $p \models_k c$. 
Let $d = Q'(a_{k+1}: C_{k} \inj C_{k+1}, \overline{Q'}(a_{k+2}: C_{k+1} \inj C_{k+2},e)$ be the subcondition of $c$ with $\lay(d) = k+1)$.
	With lemma \ref{lemma_part_satisfiability} there exists a graph $C_{k+1} \subseteq C' \subseteq C_{k+2}$ and an $Q'$ bound condition $e$ over $C'$ in ANF with $p \models  Q(a_1: C_0, \inj C_1, \ldots Q'(a_{k+1}: C_{k} \inj C_{k+1}, \overline{Q}(a_{k+2}: C_{k+1} \inj C',e)) =: d_{C',e}$. 	
Let $\mathcal{C}_{k,p,e}$ be the set of graphs $C_{k+1} \subseteq C' \subseteq C_{k+2}$ with  $p \models d_{C',e}$.

A graph $C' \in \mathcal{C}_{k,p,e}$, such that no $C'' \in \textsc{C}$ with $C' \subseteq C''$ exists is called a \emph{biggest partially
 satisfying graph} of $c$ at level $k$ with $p$ and $e$.
The set of these graphs is denoted by $\mathcal{B}_{k,p,e}$
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
 Let $G$ be a graph and $c $ a constraint in ANF, such that $G \models_k c$ and $G \not \models c$.
 Let $d = \forall(a_{k+1}: C_k \inj C_{k+1},\exists(a_{k+2}: C_{k+1} \inj C_{k+2}, \true))$ be the condition up to layer $k +2$ of of the condition at layer $k+1$ of $c$.
 The number of violations of $c$ up to layer $k+2$ in $G$ is defined as the the number of morphisms $q: C_{k+1} \to G$ that do not satisfy $\exists(a_{k+2}: C_{k+1} \inj C', \true)$, with $C'$ being the smallest graph such that $\cup_{D \in \mathcal{B}_{k,p,e}} D \subset C'$ if $G \not \models_k c$ and $0$ otherwise. This number is denoted by $\nvc(k +2, G)$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[\textbf{minimal consistency improving}]
	Let $G$ be a graph, $r$ a rule and $c$ a constraint in ANF with $G \models_k c$ and $G\not \models c$. 

	
	A transformation $G \xRightarrow{r,m} H$ is called \emph{minimal consistency improving} if  $\nvc(k +2, G) < \nvc(k +2, H)$
	The rule $r$ is called \emph{minimal consistency improving} if all of its applications are. 
	
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem_ex_lower}
Let $G$ be $p: C_0 \to G$ a morphism, $c$ a constraint in ANF over $C_0$ with $p \models_k c$.
Then $p \models_j c$ for all $j < k$ such that the subcondition of $c$ at layer $j$ is existentially bound. 

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The subcondition of $c$ at layer $k$ is existentially bound:	
	If an $j < k$ with $p \models_j c$ exists such that the subcondition of $c$ at layer $j$ is universally bound, let $j_1$ be the smallest of these. With lemma \ref{lemma_help_lay_sat} follows that $p \models_{j_2} c $ for all $j_1 < j_2$.
	Let $\ell < j_1$, such that the subcondition of $c$ at layer $j$ is existentially bound and let $d = \exists(a_{\ell}: C_{\ell} \inj C_{\ell+1}, e)$ be the condition up to layer $j_1 - \ell$ of the subcondition of $c$ at layer $\ell$. 
	Since $\ell < j_1$, a morphism $q:  C_{\ell} \to G$ with $q \models d$ must exists and therefore a morphism $q': C_{\ell +1}\to G$ with $q = q' \circ a_k$ must exists. 
	If follows that $q \models \exists(a_{\ell}: C_{\ell} \inj C_{\ell+1}, \true)$ and with that $p \models_{\ell} c$.
	
	\item The subcondition of $c$ at layer $k$ is universally bound:
	With lemma \ref{lemma_help_lay_sat} follows that $p \models_{k+1} c$. 
	Since $c$ is in ANF  $1.$ can be applied  to $k+1$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	Let $G$ be a graph, $r$ a rule and $c$ a constraint in ANF  with $G \not \models c$. 
	Let $k$ be the biggest number, such that $G \models_k c$.
	A transformation $G \xRightarrow{r,m} H$ is minimal consistency improving if $G \models_j c$ and  $k < j$.
	
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $G \not \models c$, with lemma \ref{lemma_lay_sat} follows that the subcondition of $c$ at layer $k$ has to be existentially bound and since $k$ is the biggest number such that $G\models_k c$ it follows that $\nvc(k+1,G) > 0$.
If the subcondition of $c$ at layer $j$ is universally bound, $H \models c$ follows with lemma  \ref{lemma_lay_sat} and lemma \ref{lem_ex_lower} $H \models_{k+2} c$. Therefore $\nvc(k+2,H) = 0$. 
Otherwise the subcondition of $c$ at layer $j$ is existentially bound and therefore $G \models_{k+2} c$ and $\nvc(k+2,H) = 0$ follows immediately.

%	Since $G \not \models c$, with lemma \ref{lemma_lay_sat} follows that the subcondition of $c$ at layer $k$ has to be existentially bound.
