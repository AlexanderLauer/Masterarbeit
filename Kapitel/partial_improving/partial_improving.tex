\subsection{minimal consistency improving}



\begin{definition}[\textbf{number of violations}]
Let $G$ be a graph and $c$ a constraint in EANF. 
The \emph{number of violations $\nvc(j,G)$ at layer $j$ in $G$} is defined as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $j < c_{\max}+1$:
	$$\nvc(j,G) := 0$$
\item If $j = c_{\max}+1$, let $d = \forall(a_k: C_{j} \inj C_{j+1},e)$ be the subcondition of $c$ at layer $j+1$.


$$\nvc(j,G) := \sum_{C' \in \mathcal{U}(C_j,{C_{j+1}})} |\{q \mid q:C_{j+1} \inj G \wedge q \not \models \parcond(1,e,C')\}| $$

\item If $j > c_{\max}$:
	$$\nvc(j,G) := \infty$$
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[\textbf{minimal consistency improving}]
	Let a graph $G$, a rule $r$ and a constraint $c$ in ANF be given. 

	
	A transformation $G \Longrightarrow_{r,m} H$ is called \emph{minimal consistency improving w.rt $c$}, if  $$\nvc(k, H) < \nvc(k, G) $$
	for any $0 \leq k \leq \nl(c)$.
	A rule $r$ is called \emph{minimal consistency improving}, if all of its applications are. 
	
\end{definition}


\begin{theorem}
	Let a graph $G$, a rule $r$ and a constraint $c$ in ANF be given.
	Let $k < \nl(c)$ be the biggest number, such that $G \models_k c$.
	A transformation $G \Longrightarrow_{r,m} H$ is minimal consistency improving if $G \models_j c$ and  $k < j$.
	
\end{theorem}

%\begin{proof}
%Since $k < \nl(c)$, it follows that $G \not \models c$. 
%With lemma \ref{lemma_lay_sat} follows that the subcondition of $c$ at layer $k$ has to be existentially bound and since $k$ is the biggest number such that $G\models_k c$ it follows that $\nvc(k+1,G) > 0$.
%If the subcondition of $c$ at layer $j$ is universally bound, $H \models c$ follows with lemma  \ref{lemma_lay_sat} and with lemma \ref{lem_ex_lower} $H \models_{k+2} c$ follows. Therefore, $\nvc(k+2,H) = 0$. 
%Otherwise, if the subcondition of $c$ at layer $j$ is existentially bound and therefore $G \models_{k+2} c$, $\nvc(k+2,H) = 0$ follows immediately.
%\end{proof}
\begin{proof}
No $\ell >k$ with $G\models_{\ell} c$ exists and $G \models_k c$. Hence, $\nvc(k,G) > 0$ and $\nvc(k,G) \neq \infty$. 
Since $j >k$, $\nvc(k,H) = 0$ and it follows immediately that the transformation is minimal consistency improving. 
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
Let a constraint $c$ in EANF be given. 
Every sequence of minimal consistency improving transformation w.r.t $c$ is finite.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $G_0$ be a graph and 
$$G_0 \Longrightarrow_{\rho_1} G_1 \Longrightarrow_{\rho_2} G_2 \Longrightarrow_{\rho_3} \ldots$$
be a sequence of minimal consistency improving transformations w.r.t $c$.
We assume that $\maxc{G_0} < \nl(c)$, otherwise $\nvc(j,G_0) = 0$ for all $j \in \{0, \ldots, \nl(c)\}$ and no transformation $G_0 \Longrightarrow H$ is minimal consistency improving. 

We show that after at most $j := \nvc(\cmax_{G_0}+1,G_0)$ transformations $G_j \models_{\maxc{G_0} + 2} c$ holds. 
Note that $j$ has to be finite, since $G_0$ contains only a finite number of occurrences of $C_{j+1}$.
After each transformation it holds that $\nvc(\maxc{G_{i+1}}+1,G_{i+1}) \leq \nvc(\maxc{G_i}+1,G_{i})-1$.
Therefore, after $j$ transformations $\nvc(\maxc{G_0}+1,G_{j}) \leq \nvc(\maxc{G_0}+1,G_{0})-j = 0$ holds and with that $G_j \models_{\maxc{G_0}+ 2} c$.
By iteratively applying this, it follows that after a finite number of transformations a graph $G_k$ with $G_k \models c$ exists. 
Since no minimal consistency improving transformation $G_k \Longrightarrow G_{k+1}$ exists, the sequence has to be finite. 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[\textbf{direct minimal consistency improving}]\label{def_direct_improving}
Let $G$ be a graph, $\rho$ a plain rule and $c$ a constraint in EANF.
Let $d = \forall(a_k: C_{k-1} \inj C_{k}, e)$ be the condition at layer $k = \maxc{G} + 1 \leq \nl(c)$ of $c$.
A transformation $t: G \Longrightarrow_{\rho,m} H$ is called \emph{direct minimal consistency improving} if the following equations hold. 

Every occurrence of $C_k$ in $G$ that satisfies $\parcond(1,e,C')$ for any $C' \in \mathcal{U}(C_k, C_{k+1})$ still satisfies $\parcond(1,e,C')$ in $H$. 
\begin{equation}\label{direct_improving_1}
\begin{split}
	\forall p: C_{k} \inj G\Big( \bigwedge_{C' \in \mathcal{U}(C_k, C_{k+1})}\big(& p \models \parcond(1,e,C') \wedge \track_t \circ p \text{ is total}\big) \\ &\implies  \track_t \circ p \models \parcond(1,e,C') \Big) 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Every new inserted occurrence of $C_k$ by $t$ satisfies $\parcond(1,e,C_{k+1})$.
\begin{equation}\label{direct_improving_1_2}
\begin{split}
\forall p': C_{k} \inj H \big(\neg \exists p : C_k \inj G(p' = \track_t \circ p) \implies \ p' \models \parcond(1,e,C_{k+1})\big)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
At least one occurrence of $C_k$ in $G$ that does not satisfy $\parcond(1,e,C')$, for any $C' \in \mathcal{U}(C_k, C_{k+1})$, either has been destroyed by $t$ or satisfies $\parcond(1,e,C')$ in $H$.
\begin{equation}\label{direct_improving_2}
\begin{split}
\exists p: C_k \inj G \Big(\bigvee_{C' \in \mathcal{U}(C_k, C_{k+1})}\big( &p \not \models \parcond(1,e,C') \wedge (\track_t \circ p \text{ is not total } \\&\vee(\track_t \circ p \text{ is total } \wedge \track_t \circ p  \models \parcond(1,e,C')))\big) \Big) 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

No occurrence of a universally bound graph $C_j$ with $j < k$ gets inserted. 
\begin{equation}\label{direct_improving_3}
\bigwedge_{\substack{i < k \\ i \textit{ even}}} \forall p: C_i \inj H ( \exists p': C_i \inj G (p' = \track_t \circ p))
\end{equation}
No occurrence of an existentially bound graph $C_j$ with $j < k$ gets deleted. 
\begin{equation}\label{direct_improving_4}
\bigwedge_{\substack{i < k \\ i \textit{ odd}}} \forall p: C_i \inj G( \track_t \circ p \textit{ is total})
\end{equation}

\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma_consistent}
	Let a transformation $t: G \Longrightarrow H$ and a constraint $c$ in EANF be given, such that (\ref{direct_improving_3}) and (\ref{direct_improving_4}) of definition \ref{def_direct_improving} are satisfied. Then,
	$$H \models_{\maxc{G}} c.$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Assume that $G \not \models_{\maxc{G}}c$. 
Then, either a new occurrence of an universally bound graph of $c$ has been inserted or an occurrence of an existentially bound graph of $c$ has been destroyed. 
Therefore, the following holds:
$$ \exists p: C_i \inj G(\neg \exists p': C_i \inj (p' = \track_t \circ p) \vee \exists p:C_j \inj G(\track_t \circ p \textit{ is not total})$$
with $i, j < k$, $i$ being odd and $j$ being even. 
It follows immediately that either (\ref{direct_improving_3}) or (\ref{direct_improving_4}) is not satisfied. 
This is a contradiction. 
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
Let a graph $G$, a constraint $c$ in EANF and a direct minimal improving transformation $t: G \Rightarrow_{r,m} H$ w.r.t. $c$ be given. 
Then, $t$ is also a minimal improving transformation. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Let $G$ be a graph with $k = \maxc{G}+1$ and $G \models \parcond(k,c,C)$ with $\parcond(k,c,C)\in \mathcal{P}_c^G$
Let $d$ be the subcondition of $c$ at layer $k$.
With lemma \ref{lemma_consistent} follows that $\maxc{H} \geq \maxc{G}$ and with that $\nvc(k,H) \neq \infty$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{proof_direct_minimal_4} We show that equations (\ref{direct_improving_1}) and (\ref{direct_improving_1_2}) imply that $\nvc(k,H) \leq \nvc(k,G)$. 
Assume that $\nvc(k,H) > \nvc(k,G)$. Therefore, a morphism $p: C_k \inj H$ with $p \not \models \parcond(1,d,C')$ for any $C' \in \mathcal{U}(C,C_{k+1})$ exists, such that either \ref{proof_direct_minimal_1} or \ref{proof_direct_minimal_2} is satisfied.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \label{proof_direct_minimal_1}
		There does exist a morphism $q': C_k \inj G$ with $q' \models \parcond(1,d,C')$ and $p = \track_t \circ q'$. 

	\item \label{proof_direct_minimal_2}
		There does not exist a morphism $q : C_k \inj G$, such that $p = \track_t \circ q$. 		
\end{enumerate}
This is a contradiction, if \ref{proof_direct_minimal_1} is satisfied, $q'$ does not satisfy equation (\ref{direct_improving_1}) and if \ref{proof_direct_minimal_2} is satisfied $q$ does not satisfy equation (\ref{direct_improving_1_2}).
It also follows that 
$$|\{q \mid q:C_k \inj G \wedge q \not \models \parcond(1,e,C')\}| \leq |\{q \mid q:C_{k} \inj H \wedge q \not \models \parcond(1,e,C')\}|$$
for all $C' \in \mathcal{U}(C_k, C_{k+1})$.

\item \label{proof_direct_minimal_3} Since (\ref{direct_improving_2}) is satisfied,  a morphism $p:C_k \inj G$ with $p \not \models \parcond(1,d,C')$, such that either $\track \circ p$ is total and $\track_t \circ p  \models \parcond(1,d,C')$ or $\track \circ p$ is not total exists, for any $C' \in \mathcal{U}(C_k, C_{k+1})$.
In both cases the following holds 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	p &\in \{q \mid q:C_k \inj G \wedge q \not \models \parcond(1,e,C')\} \wedge \\
	\track \circ p &\notin \{q \mid q:C_{k} \inj H \wedge q \not \models \parcond(1,e,C')\}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
With that and \ref{proof_direct_minimal_4}. it follows that
$$|\{q \mid q:C_k \inj G \wedge q \not \models \parcond(1,e,C')\}| < |\{q \mid q:C_{k} \inj H \wedge q \not \models \parcond(1,e,C')\}|.$$


\end{enumerate}
In total  $\nvc(k,H) < \nvc(k,G)$ follows and  $t$ is a minimal improving transformation. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Comparison with other consistency concepts}

\begin{lemma}\label{comp_guaranteeing_minimal}
Let a constraint $c$ in ANF, graphs $G$ and $H$ with $G \not \models c$, and a transformation $t: G \Longrightarrow H$ be given. Then, 
$$t \text{ is c-guaranteeing } \implies t \text{ is minimal consistency improving w.r.t c}$$,
$$t \text{ is c-guaranteeing } \centernot \implies t \text{ is direct minimal consistency improving w.r.t c}$$
and 
$$t \text{ is minimal consistency improving w.r.t c} \centernot\implies t \text{ is c-guaranteeing }$$
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
Let $c'$ be the equivalent constraint in EANF. 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Let $t$ be c-guaranteeing transformation, then $H \models c$. 
Since $G \not \models c$, $G \not \models c'$  follows and $\nvc(\maxc{G} + 1, G) > 0$ and $\nvc(\maxc{G} + 1, H) = 0$. Therefore $t$ is minimal consistency improving. 

\item Let a constraint $c = \exists(a_0: \emptyset \inj C_0, \forall(a_1: C_0 \inj C_1, \exists(a_2:C_1 \inj C_2, \true)))$ and a graph $G = C' \dot{\cup} C'$ with $C' = C_2 \setminus \{e\}$ for an $e \in E_{C_2\setminus C_1}$ and the occurrences $p_1: C_1 \inj G$ and $p_2: C_1 \inj G$  be given. 
Let $t: G \Longrightarrow H$ be a transformation with $H = C_2 \dot{\cup} C''$ and $C'' = C' \setminus\{e'\}$ for an $e' \in E_{C_2 \setminus C_1}$, such that $\track_t \circ p_1$ and $\track_t \circ p_2$ are total. 
Then, $t$ is $c$-guaranteeing and not direct minimal consistency improving, since $p_i \models \exists(a'_2:C_1 \inj C', \true)$  for $i = 1,2$ and either $\track_t \circ p_1 \not \models \exists(a'_2:C_1 \inj C', \true)$ or $\track_t \circ p_2 \not \models \exists(a'_2:C_1 \inj C', \true)$.

\item Let $t$ be a minimal consistency improving transformation w.r.t $c'$, such that $\nvc(\maxc{G} + 1, H)> \nvc(\maxc{G} + 1, H) > 1$ and $H \not \models_{\maxc{G} + 2} c'$.
Then,$H \not \models c'$ and $t$ is not a guaranteeing transformation. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Let $c$ be an existentially bound constraint in ANF. 
Then, a transformation $t$ is $c$-guaranteeing if and only if it is consistency improving. 
With lemma \ref{comp_guaranteeing_minimal} follows:
$$t \text{ is consistency guaranteeing w.r.t c } \implies t \text{ is minimal consistency improving w.r.t c}$$
and 
$$t \text{ is minimal consistency improving w.r.t c} \centernot\implies t \text{ is consistency improving w.r.t c }$$
\end{corollary}

\begin{lemma}
	let a universally bound constraint $c$ with $\nl(c) = 1$ in ANF, graphs $G$ and $H$ with $G \not \models c$, and a transformation $t: G \Longrightarrow H$ be given. 
	Then,
	$$t \text{ is consistency improving } \iff \text{ is minimal consistency improving}$$ 
	
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $c = \forall(a: \emptyset \inj C, \false)$. Then, the equivalent constraint in EANF is $c' = \forall(a:\emptyset \inj C, \exists(\id: C \inj C, \false)$. 
Since $\mathcal{U}(C,C) = \{C\}$, $\nvc(1,G)$ is the number of occurrences of $C$ in $G$. 
This is exactly the definition of the number of violations for consistency improving transformations and 
$$t \text{ is minimal consistency improving } \iff t \text{ is consistency improving}$$
follows immediately.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Let a universally bound constraint $c$ with $\nl(c) \geq 2$ in ANF, graphs $G$ and $H$ with $G\not \models c$ and a transformation $t: G \Longrightarrow H$ be given. Then,

$$t \text{ is direct consistency improving } \centernot \implies t \text{ is minimal consistency improving}$$ 
and 
$$t \text{ is direct minimal consistency improving } \centernot \implies t \text{ is consistency sustaining}$$ 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $c = \forall(a_0: \emptyset \inj C_0, \exists(a_1: C_0 \inj C_1, \true))$ be a constraint.
Let $V_{C_0} = V_{C_1}$ and $|E_{C_1}| - |E_{C_0}| = 2$. Let $G = C' \dot \cup C'$ with $C' = C_1 \setminus \{e\}$ with $e \in E_{C_1}\setminus E_{C_0} $ and the occurrences $p_1: C_0 \inj G$ and $p_2: C_0 \inj G$ be given. It follows that $\nvc(1,G) = 2$.
Let $t: G \Longrightarrow H$ be a transformation, such that $H = C_0$. 
Then, $t$ is a direct consistency improving transformation, since $H$ contains only one occurrence of $C_0$ not satisfying $\exists(a_1:C_0 \inj C_1 \true)$. But, $t$ is not minimal consistency improving since $\nvc(1,H) = 3$.

\item Let $c := \forall(a_0: \emptyset \inj C_0, \exists(a_1: C_0 \inj C_1, \forall(a_2: C_1 \inj C_2, \exists(a_3: C_2 \inj C_3, \true))))$ be a constraint.

Let a graph $G = C_0$ with the morphism $q: C_0 \inj G$ and a transformation $t: G \Longrightarrow H$ with $H := C_2 \dot{\cup} C_2$ be given, such that $\track_t \circ q$ is total. 
	Then $t$ is a direct minimal consistency improving transformation but not a consistency sustaining one, since $H$ contains more occurrences of $C_0$ not satisfying $\exists(a_1: C_0 \inj C_1, \forall(a_2: C_1 \inj C_2, \exists(a_3: C_2 \inj C_3, \true)))$ than $G$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Let a universally bound constraint $c$ with $\nl(c) \geq 2$ in ANF, graphs $G$ and $H$ with $G \not \models c$ and a transformation $t: G \Longrightarrow H$ be given. 
If $t$ satisfies $(\ref{direct_improving_1})$ and $(\ref{direct_improving_1_2})$, $H \models_{\maxc{G}} c$ and 
$$\exists p:C_0 \inj G(p \not \models \parcond(\maxc{G} + 2, c, \true) \wedge \track_t \circ p \models c).$$
Then,  
$$t \text{ is consistency improving} \implies t \text{ is minimal consistency improving}.$$ 

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
