\subsection{Comparison with other consistency concepts and basic increasing rules}

\input{figures/consistency_relations_basic_rules.tex}

Before we continue with the construction of application conditions for basic increasing rules, let us once more compare the notion of direct consistency increasing with the notions of (direct) consistency improving and sustaining and consistency guaranteeing and preserving with the restriction that only basic increasing rules are used. 
The results of these differ from the results of chapter \ref{comp_general} and are displayed in figure \ref{fig:consistency_relations_basic}.
It can be seen that in the case of basic increasing rules  the notions of direct consistency increasing and direct consistency improving are related in the sense that improving implies direct increasing and therefore direct increasing is a finer notion than improving. 

Additionally, with lemma \ref{lemma:equiv_direct_normal} follows immediately that guaranteeing implies direct increasing. 
We show that improving implies (direct) increasing and that (direct) increasing does not imply sustaining which also implies that increasing does not imply improving since each improving transformation is also a sustaining one. 
\begin{lemma}
Let a constraint $c$ in UANF, a basic increasing rule $\rho$ and a transformation $t: G \Longrightarrow_{\rho} H$ be given. 
Then, 
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		&t \text{ is improving w.r.t $c$ } \implies t \text{ is direct consistency increasing w.r.t $c$ } \wedge \\
		&t \text{ is direct increasing w.r.t $c$ } \centernot \implies t \text{ is consistency sustaining w.r.t $c$}
	\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $t$ be a consistency improving transformation w.r.t $c$. 

\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
