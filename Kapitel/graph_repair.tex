\section{Rule-based Graph Repair}\label{repair}

In the following, we present our rule-based graph repair approach.
First, we propose a graph repair process for a constraint in UANF, and second, a repair process for a set of constraints in UANF, both based on a given set of rules $\mathcal{R}$. In addition, we need to make further assumptions for these constraints and sets of constraints, namely that they are \emph{circular conflict free}, in order to guarantee that our approach terminates.
