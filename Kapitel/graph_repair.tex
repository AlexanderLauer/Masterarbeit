\section{Rule-based Graph Repair}

In the following we present our rule-based graph repair approach.
First, we propose an graph repair process for one constraint in UANF and second,
 a repair process for a set of constraints in UANF, both based on a given 
set of rules $\mathcal{R}$.
Additionally, we need to make further assumptions for these constraints and constraint sets, namely, that they are \emph{circular conflict free} to guarantee that our approach terminates.
