\section{Preliminaries}
Our graph repair process is based on the concept of the double-pushout approach \cite{hartmut2006fundamentals}. 
In this chapter we will introduce some formal prerequisites like graphs, graph morphisms, nested graph conditions and constraints and graph transformations. 
  
\subsection{Graphs and Graph morphisms}
We start by introducing the notions of graphs and graph morphisms according to \cite{hartmut2006fundamentals}.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{graph}]
	A \emph{graph} $G = (V,E,\src, \tar)$ consists of a set of
	 vertices (or nodes)
	$V$, a set of edges $E$ and two mappings $\src, \tar: E \to 
	V$ that assign the source and target vertices to an edge.
	That means, given an edge $e \in E$, then $e$ connects the 
	vertices $\tar(e)$ and $\src(e)$. 
	
	If a tuple as above is not given, $V_G$, $E_G$, $\tar_G$ and
	$\src_G$ denotes the sets of vertices, edges and the target
	and source mappings, respectively.

\end{definition}

For the remainder of this paper we assume that all graphs are finite, that means
given a graph $G$ the sets $V_G$ and $E_G$ are finite.
	
\begin{definition}[\textbf{graph morphism}]
	Let graphs $G$ and $H$ be given. A \emph{graph morphism}
	$f : G \to H$ consists of two mappings $f_V: V_G \to V_H$
	and $f_E: E_G \to E_H$ such that the source and target 
	functions are preserved. That means,
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
			&f_V \circ \src_G = \src_H \circ f_E \wedge \\
			&f_V \circ \tar_G = \tar_G \circ f_E
		\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	holds.
	A graph morphism $f$ is called injective (surjective) if 
	$f_E$ and $f_V$ are injective (surjective) mappings.
	If $f$ is injective, it is denoted by  $f: G \inj H$ and
	we may also call it \emph{inclusion}.
	Two morphisms $f_1 :G_1 \to H$ and $f_2: G_2 \to H$ 
	are called \emph{jointly surjective} if for each element
	$e$ of $H$ either an element $e' \in G_1$ with $f_1(e') =e$
	or an element $e' \in G_2$ with $f_2(e') = e$ exists. 

\end{definition}

For our newly introduced notions of consistency increase- and 
maintainment we also need to consider \emph{sub-graphs}, \emph{overlaps} of graphs and 
so-called \emph{intermediate-graphs} which intuitively denotes graphs $G'$ that lay in between two given graphs $G$ and $H$.
That means, $G$ is a sub-graph of $G'$ and $G'$ is a sub-graph 
of $H$.


\begin{definition}[\textbf{sub-graph}]
	Let $G$ and $H$ be graphs. Then, $G$ is called a 
	\emph{sub-graph} of $H$ if an injective morphism $p: G \inj H$
	exists.
\end{definition}
Note that with this definition every graph $G$ is a sub-graph
of itself since the morphism $p$ is also allowed to be surjective.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{intermediate-graph}]
	Let $G$ and $H$ be graphs such that $G$ is a sub-graph of $H$. 
	A graph $C$ is called an \emph{intermediate-graph} of $G$ 
	and $H$, if $G$ is a sub-graph of $C$ and $C$ is a sub-graph of $H$. 
	The set of intermediate-graphs of $G$ and 
	$H$ is denoted by $\ig{G}{H}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[\textbf{overlap}]
	Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be graphs. A graph $H$ is called an 
	\emph{overlap of $G_1$ and $G_2$} if morphisms $i: G_1 \inj H$ 
	and $i' :G_2 \inj H$ exist such that $i$ and $i'$ are 
	jointly surjective and $i(G_1) \cap i'(G_2)\neq \emptyset$. 
	The morphisms $i$ and $i'$ are called \emph{overlap morphisms}.

	The set of all overlaps of $G_1$ and $G_2$ is denoted by 
	$\overlay(G_1,G_2)$. Given an overlap $H$ of $G_1$ and $G_2$, 
	the overlap morphisms are denoted by $i_{G_1}^H$ and 
	$i_{G_2}^H$, respectively.
\end{definition}

Note that, graphs $H$ such that jointly surjective morphisms $i : G_1 \inj H$ and $i':G_2 \inj H$ such that $i(G_1) \cap i'(G_2)= \emptyset$ can also be considered as overlap of $G_1$ and $G_2$.
Since, for this paper we will only consider overlaps that satisfy 
$i(G_1) \cap i'(G_2)\neq \emptyset$, we directly embedded this 
property into the definition.
 
As mentioned above, our approach also considers 
intermediate-graphs. Therefore a notion to restrict given
graph morphisms $p: G \to H$ is needed. For this, we introduce the notion
of \emph{restricted morphisms} which intuitively is the 
restriction of the domain and co-domain of $p$ with sub-graphs of 
$G$ and $H$, respectively.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{restricted morphism}]
	Let graphs $G$, $H$ and a morphism $f : G \to H$ be given. 
	Then, a morphism $f' : G' \to H'$ is called a 
	\emph{restricted morphism} of $p$ if morphisms $i: G' \inj G$
	and $i': H' \inj H$ exists ($G'$ is a subgraph of $G$ and $H'$ 
	a sub-graph of $H$) and 
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
			&i'_E \circ f'_E = f_E \circ i_E \wedge \\
			&i'_V \circ f'_V = f_V \circ i_V		
		\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	holds. Given an morphism $p$, we use the notation 
	$p^r$ to denote that $p^r$ is a restricted morphism of $p$.
\end{definition}
Note that, given a morphism $p: G \to H$ a restriction 
$p^r: G' \to H'$ of $p$ is uniquely determined by $G'$ and $H'$
meaning that, given two restrictions $q: G' \to H'$ and 
$q': G' \to H$ of $p$ it follows immediately that $q = q'$. 

\subsection{Nested Graph Conditions and Constraints}
\emph{Nested graph constraints} are useful to specify graph 
properties. The more general notion of \emph{nested graph conditions} allows the specification of properties for graph 
morphisms and the definition of graph constraints in a recursive
manner. These conditions allow the use of quantifiers and boolean 
operators.
 


\begin{definition}[\textbf{nested graph condition}\cite{habel2009correctness}]
A \emph{nested graph condition} over a graph $C_0$ is recursively defined as:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textsf{true} is a  graph condition over every graph.
	\item $\exists(a_0:C_0 \inj C_1,d)$ is a graph condition over $C_0$ if $a_0$ is a injective graph morphism and $d$ is a graph condition over $C_1$. 
	\item $\neg d$, $d_1 \wedge d_2$ and $d_1 \vee d_2$ are 
		  graph conditions over $C_0$ if $d$, $d_1$ and $d_2$
		  are graph conditions over $C_0$.
	
\end{enumerate}
	Conditions over the empty graph $\emptyset$ are called \emph{constraints}.
We use the abbreviations $\forall(a_0:C_0 \xhookrightarrow{} C_1,d) := \neg \exists(a_0:C_0 \xhookrightarrow{} C_1,\neg d)$ and $\false = \neg \true$.



Conditions of the form $\exists(a_0:C_0 \inj C_1, d)$ are called 
\emph{existentially bound}, the graph $C_1$ is also called
existentially bound. 
Conditions of the form $\forall(a_0:C_0 \inj C_1, d)$ are called 
\emph{universally bound}, the graph $C_1$ is also called
universally bound. 

\end{definition}

Since these are the only types of conditions used in this 
paper we will only refer to it as \emph{conditions} and 
\emph{constraints}.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{semantic of graph conditions}]
	Let a graph $G$, a condition $c$ over $C_0$ and a graph 
	morphism $p: C_0 \inj G$ be given. Then, $p$ satisfies $c$,
	denoted by $p \models c$ if 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item	
			If $c = \true$, $p \models c$.
		\item 
			If $c = \exists(a_0:C_0 \inj C_1,d)$, then $p \models c$
			if an injective morphism $q :C_1 \inj G$ with 
			$p = q \circ a$ exists, such that $q \models d$. 
		\item 
			If $c = \neg d$, then $p \models c$ if $p \not \models 
			d$. 
		\item 
			If $c = d_1 \wedge d_2$, then $p \models c$ if 
			$p \models d_1$ and $p \models d_2$.
		\item 
			If $c = d_1 \vee d_2$, then $p \models c$ if 
			$p \models d_1$ or $p \models d_2$.			
	\end{enumerate}
	A graph $G$ satisfies a constraint $c$, denoted by $G \models 
	c$, if the morphism $p: \emptyset \inj G$ satisfies $c$.
\end{definition}

Our approach is designed to repair a specific type of nested 
constraint, namely \emph{linear conditions} which are conditions
without any boolean operators. In particular, our approach is able
to repair constraints in \emph{alternating quantifier normal form (ANF)} 
which are linear conditions with alternating quantifiers, since 
every linear condition can be transformed into an equivalent 
condition in ANF \cite{sandmann2019rule}.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{alternating quantifier normal form (ANF)}\cite{sandmann2019rule}]
	Conditions in \emph{alternating quantifier normal form} (ANF) 
	are inductively defined as 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\true$ and $\false$ are conditions in ANF.
		\item 
			$\exists(a_0: C_0 \inj C_1,d)$ is a condition in ANF
			if either $d$ is universally bound or $d =\true$.
		\item
			$\forall(a_0: C_0 \inj C_1,d)$ is a condition in ANF
			if either $d$ is existentially bound or $d = \false$.
	\end{enumerate}
	In both cases, $d$ is called a \emph{sub-condition} of 
	$\exists(a: C_0 \inj C_1,d)$ or $\forall(a: C_0 \inj C_1,d)$ respectively. 
	The \emph{nesting level} $\nlvl(c)$ of a condition $c$ is 
	recursively defined as $\nlvl(\true) = 0$ and  $\nlvl
	(\exists(a: P \to Q, d)) := \nlvl(d) +1$.
\end{definition}

In literature conditions in ANF allow also conditions that end 
with $\exists(a_0: C_0 \inj C_1, \false)$ or $\forall(a_0:C_0 \inj
C_1, \true)$. We exclude these cases such that conditions in ANF
are only allowed to end with conditions of the type $\exists(a_0: 
C_0 \inj C_1, \true)$ or $\forall(a_0:C_0 \inj C_1, \false)$ since
it can be easily seen that every morphism $p: C_0 \inj G$ satisfies
$\forall(a_0:C_0 \inj C_1, \true)$ and does not satisfy $\exists(a_0: C_0 \inj C_1, \false)$. Therefore, these conditions can be replaced by $\true$ and $\false$ respectively.

In the following, we assume that all conditions are finite. As a direct 
consequence of this, the nesting level is also finite.

\subsection{Rules and Graph Transformations}
Via \emph{rules} and \emph{graph transformation} to manipulate
given graphs by the deletion and insertion of edges and vertices. 
For our approach, we use the concept of the double-pushout 
approach for rules and transformations 
\cite{hartmut2006fundamentals}. A rule consists of the three graphs $L$, called the \emph{left-hand side},$K$, called \emph{context}  and $R$ called \emph{right-hand side} with $K$ being a sub-graph of $L$ and $R$. During a transformation, denoted by $G 
\Longrightarrow H$, elements of $L \setminus K$
will be removed and elements of $R \setminus K$ will be inserted 
such that a new morphism $p: R \inj H$ has been created.
Additionally, the so-called \emph{dangling edge condition} has to be satisfied, meaning that for each edge $e \in E_H$ there do
exists vertices $u,v \in V_H$ such that $\tar(e) = u$ and 
$\src(e) = v$ or vice versa.
Also, we define application conditions which are nested conditions
over $L$ and $R$ which are are able prevent transformation if 
these are not satisfied. 
We will use the concept of application conditions to guarantee
that transformations are not able to decrease consistency. 
For example, application conditions that prevent a transformation 
if $G \models c$ and $H\not \models c$, given a constraint $c$.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{rules and application conditions}]
	A \emph{plain rule} $\rho' = \rle{L}{l}{K}{r}{R}$ consists of 
	graphs $L,K,R$ and injective graph morphisms $l: K \inj L$ 
	and $r:  K \inj R$. The rule $\rho'^{-1} = \rle{R}{r}{K}{l}{L}$
	is called the \emph{inverse rule of $\rho'$}. 
	
	An \emph{application condition} is a nested condition over 
	$L$ or $R$, respectively. A \emph{rule} $(\ap_L, \rho', \ap_R)$ 
	contains of a plain rule $\rho'$ and application conditions 
	$\ap_L$ over $L$, called \emph{left application condition}, 
	and $\ap_R$	over $R$, called \emph{right application 
	condition}, respectively. 
\end{definition}



\begin{definition}[\textbf{graph transformation}]
	Let a rule $\rho = (\ap_L,\rho', \ap_R)$, a graph $G$ 
	and a morphism $m: L \inj G$,
	called \emph{match}, be given. Then, a \emph{graph 
	transformation} $t: G \Longrightarrow_{\rho,m} H$ is given
	in figure \ref{fig_dpo} if the squares $(1)$ and $(2)$ are
	pushouts in the sense of category theory, $m\models \ap_L$
	and the morphism $n:L \to H$, called the co-match of $t$, 
	satisfies $\ap_R$.
\end{definition}

\input{figures/fig_dpo}

The presence of right applications conditions leads to unpleasant side-effects.
The satisfaction of a right application condition can only be checked after 
the transformation. Therefore, in case that this application condition is 
not satisfied, the transformation must be reversed. To avoid this, we introduce the \emph{shift over rule} construction which is able to transform a right into a
left application condition \cite{habel2009correctness}. This notion is based
on the notion of \emph{shift over morphism} which allows to shift a condition
over $C_0$ over a morphism $p: C \inj C_0$.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{shift over rule}]\label{def:shift}
	Let a plain rule $\rho = \rle{L}{l}{K}{r}{R}$ and a right 
	application condition $\ap$ of the form 
	$\neg \exists(m:R \inj C, \true)$ be given. Then, $\ap$
	can be shifted into a  left application condition with the 
	transformation $t: C \Longrightarrow_{\rho^{-1},m} C'$.
	The shifted condition over $\rho$, $\shift(\ap, \rho)$, is
	given by $\neg \exists(n: L \inj C', \true)$ with $n$ being the 
	co-match of $t$. 
\end{definition}

Shift over rule produces an equivalent left application condition, 
meaning that, given a right application condition $\ap$ and a plain rule $\rho$ , a match of a transformation satisfies $\shift(\ap,
\rho)$ if and only if the co-match satisfies $\ap$ \cite{habel2009correctness}. In general, every right application
condition can be shifted into an equivalent left application condition and vice versa. Since we only need to shift conditions
of the form $\neg \exists(a:R \inj C, \true)$ we introduced
the shift only for these kind of application conditions and assume that each rule only contains left application conditions, denoted by $(\ap, \rho)$.

Via the \emph{track morphism} it is possible to track elements across a transformation \cite{plump2005confluence}. 

\begin{definition}[\textbf{track morphism}]
	Consider the transformation $t$ shown in figure \ref{fig_dpo}.
	The \emph{track morphism}, $\track_t: G \to H$, of $t$ is 
	defined as
	$$\track_t = \begin{cases}
					h (g^{-1}(e)) & \text{if $ e \in g(D)$} \\
					\text{undefined} & \text{otherwise.}
				 \end{cases}$$

\end{definition}

For example, given a transformation $t: G \Longrightarrow H$, via the track morphism it can be checked whether a morphism $p:C \inj G$ is still present in the derived graph $H$ by checking whether $\track_t \circ p$ is total, or that a 
new morphism $q:C \inj H$ has been inserted by checking that no morphism
$p : C \inj H$ with $q = \track_t \circ p$ exists.
